# AliExpress Show VAT
  
Small UserScript that adds VAT (Sales Tax) to AliExpress prices. Edited prices will show a red underscore.  
  
Default setting assumes using Â£ and 20% VAT rate. This can be edited at the top of the script.  
  
To change currency just press "F12" and then select a currency symbol you find on the page. For some reason AliExpress does not use the standard keyboard symbols so you can't just type it in.
