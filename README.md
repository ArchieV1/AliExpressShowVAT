# AliExpress Show VAT
Small UserScript that adds VAT (Sales Tax) to AliExpress prices. Edited prices will show a red underscore.  
  
Default setting assumes using Â£ and 20% VAT rate. This can be edited at the top of the script.  
  
## Install
Download/Copy and paste `AliExpressShowVAT.user.js` and then load it into [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/]) or [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) installed on your browser of choice


## Non-Common currencies
To change currency just press "F12" on AliExpress and then select a currency symbol you find on the page then copy and paste it into the script.  
For some reason AliExpress does not use the standard keyboard symbols so you can't just type it in.
  
If you use an AliExpress with a non-.com domain you will need to find and replace all ".com" in the script with your TLD
